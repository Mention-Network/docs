## 3. How We Collect Your Data

We collect data:

- Directly from you (e.g., when you submit a form or email us)
- Automatically via cookies or analytics tools
- From your blockchain wallet when you connect to the protocol

We do not knowingly collect special categories of personal data unless you voluntarily provide them.

## Blockchain-Specific Considerations

Mention Network is a decentralized protocol that interacts with public blockchains.

- Wallet addresses and transaction data may be **public and immutable**, recorded permanently on a blockchain.
- **Right to Erasure and Rectification**: These rights cannot be fulfilled for on-chain data due to the decentralized and immutable nature of blockchain technology.
- We encourage users to understand that by using decentralized applications, certain rights under GDPR may be **technically limited**.

## International Data Transfers

Your data may be processed outside of the EEA/UK, including in jurisdictions without equivalent data protection laws (e.g., Hong Kong or the United States).

When transferring data internationally, we use:

- **Standard Contractual Clauses** approved by the European Commission
- Transfers to countries with **adequacy decisions**
- Where applicable, supplementary safeguards such as encryption and access controls

## 6. Third-Party Disclosures

We may share your personal data with the following categories of recipients:

- **Hosting providers and cloud infrastructure** (e.g., Vercel, AWS)
- **Email service providers** (e.g., MailerLite, Mailchimp)
- **Analytics platforms** (e.g., Plausible, Google Analytics ‚Äì with anonymization where possible)
- **Blockchain validators and smart contracts** as part of protocol usage

We ensure these providers adhere to data protection obligations under relevant laws.

## 7. Cookies & Tracking Technologies

| **Cookie Type**        | **Purpose**                    | **Duration**         |
