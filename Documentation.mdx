# Executive Summary

As AI models like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini become the default gateways to information, the way brands capture attention is fundamentally changing. Traditional Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is becoming obsolete. The new frontier is Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). In this new paradigm, what matters is how often AI mentions a brand, in what context, and with what positioning. [Mention.Network](http://Mention.Network) is creating the first decentralized, community-powered data layer to track and amplify brand visibility in AI-driven search, turning Web3 user participation into on-chain value.

# Vision & Mission

Mention Network is building the world‚Äôs first decentralized platform for AI visibility analytics and brand intelligence in the era of Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). As LLMs become dominant discovery tools, Mention Network helps both users and brands understand how often specific names are cited in AI-generated answers. Through a browser extension, Mention anonymously tracks AI-brand interactions‚Äîturning natural language prompts into Mention Points, a new metric for AI visibility that rewards users without compromising privacy.

The mission of Mention Network is to:

- **Empower users** to track and monetize their AI activity with on-device anonymization.
- **Enable brands** to monitor their presence in ChatGPT and LLM answers through decentralized analytics;
- **Advance a privacy-first, token-powered data layer** that transforms AI engagement into transparent, community-owned insights.

[Mention.Network](http://Mention.Network) is redefining how visibility, reputation, and discovery work in AI search‚Äîunlocking a new frontier where brand presence is no longer measured by web rankings, but by **mentions in the answer**.

# **The Paradigm Shift: From SEO to GEO**

The era of blue-link dominance is over. In 2025, the new path to online discovery runs through generative engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini‚Äînot search engine results pages. As of mid-2025, generative AI platforms collectively handle over 2.2 billion monthly queries, officially surpassing traditional web search in volume. This marks a pivotal shift: brands no longer compete for a top-ranking link‚Äîthey compete to be mentioned in the answer. This is the foundation of Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)‚Äîthe practice of making content eligible for inclusion in LLM-generated responses. GEO content is not just keyword-rich‚Äîit must be structured, verifiable, and semantically relevant, enabling models like ChatGPT to confidently cite, summarize, or reference it. In the GEO paradigm, visibility favors content that is easy to extract, contextually grounded, and aligns with the AI‚Äôs retrieval and reasoning patterns.

Since January 2025, the growth of AI-augmented search has been exponential. Google‚Äôs AI Overviews rose from 6.5% to nearly 20% of desktop queries in just four months‚Äîa 200% surge in search penetration. Meanwhile, ChatGPT‚Äôs daily prompt volume has doubled to 2.5 billion, making it the most-used generative interface globally. Referral traffic from generative engines is up 123% year-over-year, growing 165√ó faster than organic SEO traffic and converting at 23% higher rates. These signals point to a new competitive arena: the AI answer box. For brands aiming to stay discoverable in 2025 and beyond, GEO is no longer optional‚Äîit‚Äôs the new SEO.
