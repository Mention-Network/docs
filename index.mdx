## Executive Summary

As AI models like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini become the default gateways to information, the way brands capture attention is fundamentally changing. Traditional Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is becoming obsolete. The new frontier is Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). In this new paradigm, what matters is how often AI mentions a brand, in what context, and with what positioning. [Mention Network](http://Mention.Network) is creating the first decentralized, community-powered data layer to track and amplify brand visibility in AI-driven search, turning Web3 user participation into on-chain value.
