### How It Works?

Our ecosystem creates a self-reinforcing loop where user participation fuels data insights, which in turn generates value for brands. Revenue is then distributed back to the community on-chain.

1. **üë• Community Contribution:** Users, via the Chrome Extension, contribute anonymized data on how AIs mention brands.
2. **‚öôÔ∏è Protocol Aggregation:** The [Mention.Network](http://Mention.Network) protocol processes this data on its decentralized layer.
3. **üìä Brand Insights:** The data powers the [Mention.Network](http://Mention.Network) Dashboard, which brands and agencies subscribe to for GEO insights.
4. **üí∏ Value Distribution:** Revenue from brand subscriptions is used to fund protocol development and is distributed as on-chain rewards back to the community contributors, creating a sustainable, circular economy.
