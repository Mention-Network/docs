Mention Network is building the world’s first decentralized platform for AI visibility analytics and brand intelligence in the era of Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). As LLMs become dominant discovery tools, Mention Network helps both users and brands understand how often specific names are cited in AI-generated answers. Through a browser extension, Mention anonymously tracks AI-brand interactions—turning natural language prompts into Mention Points, a new metric for AI visibility that rewards users without compromising privacy.

The mission of Mention Network is to:

- **Empower users** to track and monetize their AI activity with on-device anonymization.
- **Enable brands** to monitor their presence in ChatGPT and LLM answers through decentralized analytics;
- **Advance a privacy-first, token-powered data layer** that transforms AI engagement into transparent, community-owned insights.

[Mention.Network](http://Mention.Network) is redefining how visibility, reputation, and discovery work in AI search—unlocking a new frontier where brand presence is no longer measured by web rankings, but by **mentions in the answer**.
